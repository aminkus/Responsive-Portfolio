# Responsive-Portfolio

This project required adding media queries to our CSS file within our original Portfolio projectmin order to make the content responsive to varying screen sizes.

## Getting Started

By using the media query syntax in our CSS file we were able to create a more responsive website. Additionally, by using the inspector tools through the Google Chrome browser we were able to target which elements required manipulationg in order to gain the responsive look we were aiming for.
