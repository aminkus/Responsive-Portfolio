            <p class="fontStyle">Hello and welcome to my first webpage. My appreciation for web design has grown exponentially. Never would I have known how difficult it can be to create an attrative layout using HTML and CSS. My goal is to look back at this design years from now and see how far I have come</p>
            <p class="fontStyle">As far as my background, I completed my undergraduate degree from California Polytechnic State University in Environmental Horticultural Science. I then spent the next 10 years of my life in the industry, beginning as a section grower to eventually becoming a director of operations for an indoor agriculrtual production faciltiy. Although I love agriculture it was not providing me with a creative output that I was searching for.</p>
            <p class="fontStyle">I now find myself in one the most challenging endeavors I have had and I look forward to the growth that will come from the struggle. My goal is to combine my background in plant science with technology and create solutions to help people.</p>
